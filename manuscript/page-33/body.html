One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.</p><p>Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as yours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.</p><p>But success SHALL crown my endeavours. Wherefore not?

Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man?</p></div> </div>
