They put it into a bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone.</p><p>Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.</p></div> </div>
